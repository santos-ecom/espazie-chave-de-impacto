RewriteEngine On

# 1. Force HTTPS
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

# 2. Redirect /chaveshopify to root
RewriteRule ^chaveshopify/?$ / [L,R=301]

# 3. DIRECTORY INDEX PRIORITY
# This is the key. Tell Apache to look for index.html FIRST.
# If index.html exists, serve it. If not, look for index.php.
DirectoryIndex index.html index.php

# 4. Optional: If you want to be absolutely sure index.php is ignored for the root:
# <Files index.php>
#     Order allow,deny
#     Deny from all
# </Files>
# (But that might break WP completely if they need it for something else, let's stick to DirectoryIndex first)
