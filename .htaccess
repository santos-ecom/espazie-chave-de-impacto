RewriteEngine On

# 1. Force HTTPS
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

# 2. Redirect /chaveshopify to root (handling lingering cache/links)
RewriteRule ^chaveshopify/?$ / [L,R=301]

# 3. Handle Clean URLs (Slugs) -> Serve index.html if it exists in a folder
# This is default behavior for Apache but good to be explicit
DirectoryIndex index.html index.php

# 4. Fallback for the root to use index.php (which serves index.html safely)
# IF index.html is prioritized, this might be skipped, but we want to ensure index.php LOGIC runs if accessed directly
# But generally index.html taking precedence is SAFER for speed.
# Let's verify: we want index.html logic.
# The user's problem was "stuck on chaveshopify". 
# Ensure no redirects FROM root TO chaveshopify exist.
